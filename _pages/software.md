 * [SBI](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/) (python) - general purpose SBI framework
 * [SBI Benchmarking](https://github.com/mackelab/sbibm/) (python) - for benchmarking
 * [MadMiner](https://madminer-tool.github.io/madminer-tutorial/tutorial/0_intro.html) - aimed at particle physics
 * [swyft](https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft) (python) the reference implementation of Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), an efficient, simulation-based inference technique for complex data and expensive simulators
 * [carl](http://diana-hep.org/carl/) an early NN-based SBI package
 * [lampe](https://github.com/francois-rozet/lampe) (python) is a flexible, amortized sbi library. The philosophy of LAMPE is to avoid obfuscation and expose all components so it is most useful for researchers.
 * [pydelfi](https://github.com/justinalsing/pydelfi) (python) with neural density estimators and adaptive acquisition of simulations.
 * [BayesFlow](https://bayesflow.org/) (python) - amortized Bayesian workflows with neural SBI, made for applied researchers and machine learning scientists alike.
